## 🎯 Test Categories

### **Smoke Tests** 🧪
- Basic system availability
- Core service initialization
- Essential component loading

### **Core Functionality Tests** 🎯
- Individual feature verification
- Pattern implementation validation
- Service functionality testing

### **Integration Tests** 🔗
- System coordination
- End-to-end workflows
- Performance validation

### **Error Handling Tests** ⚠️
- Graceful failure handling
- Invalid input validation
- System recovery testing

## 🔧 Test Configuration

The tests are configured in `playwright.config.ts` with:

- **Multiple browser support** (Chrome, Firefox, Safari)
- **Mobile viewport testing**
- **Automatic dev server startup**
- **Screenshot and video capture on failure**
- **Parallel test execution**
- **Retry logic for CI environments**

## 📊 Test Results

### HTML Report
```bash
npx playwright show-report
```

### JSON Results
```bash
# Results saved to test-results/results.json
```

### JUnit XML
```bash
# Results saved to test-results/results.xml
```

## 🚨 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Game not loading**
   - Ensure dev server is running (`npm run dev`)
   - Check console for JavaScript errors
   - Verify save/load manager initialization

2. **Tests timing out**
   - Increase timeout in `playwright.config.ts`
   - Check game initialization performance
   - Verify browser compatibility

3. **Component not found**
   - Check if component is properly exported
   - Verify global exposure in `main.ts`
   - Check for JavaScript errors in console

### Debug Mode

Run tests with `--debug` flag to:
- Pause execution at each step
- Inspect browser state
- Step through test execution
- Debug component interactions

## 📈 Performance Testing

The e2e tests include performance validation:

- **Game load time**: Must complete within 10 seconds
- **Save operations**: Must complete within 1 second
- **System responsiveness**: Must remain stable during operations
- **Memory usage**: Must not grow excessively

## 🔄 Continuous Integration

These tests are designed for CI/CD pipelines:

- **Headless execution** for automated environments
- **Retry logic** for flaky tests
- **Parallel execution** for faster feedback
- **Comprehensive reporting** for team visibility

## 🎮 Manual Testing

For manual testing and debugging:

1. **Expose test runner globally**:
   ```typescript
   (window as any).testRunner = new E2ETestRunner();
   ```

2. **Run specific test categories**:
   ```typescript
   await testRunner.runSmokeTests();
   await testRunner.runCoreTests();
   await testRunner.runIntegrationTests();
   ```

3. **Get test results**:
   ```typescript
   const results = testRunner.getTestResults();
   console.log(results);
   ```
